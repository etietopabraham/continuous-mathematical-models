Let's begin!

Introduction; Lectures with exercises, homework, group tasks, and final individual tasks (reviewing a paper, and modeling tasks)

Why Continuous Mathematical Models; ?

A model is a simp;lified rep of real life shit.

Heuristic models, natural models, mathematical models, traditional types (graphical, analogous, etc)

Modeling and Thinking;

Types of mental opeartions; comparison, analysis, synthesis, abstraction, concretization, induction, deduction, classification, generalization.

E.g. the crows count.

A mathematical model is a description of a system using mathematical concepts and languages.

A little history, at first we count by fingers, and then symbols for zero in accounting texts at 1740BC, by the Egyptians. 
The symbol nfr, meaning beautiful, was also used to indicate the base level of drawings of tombs and pytramids and distances 
were measured relative to the bsae line as being above or below this line.

Keplers' laws in 1609, 1619; 
The orbit of every planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci
A line joining a planet...

Newton's laws in 1687

Variables and Functions forms the symbols for mobdeing; x, d/dx f(x), f(x)

df(x) = d'(x)dx = derivative
vs differential, a point of interest of a function when a line is drawn and the angle is taken.

OK, back to why;

Cognition purposes
Creation of objects (situations, events) with particular properties, i.e. what to do
Making forcasts, i.e. what wil lhappen if, and 
Process optimization.

Distinguish between projections (all accounts being equal) and forecasts (taking into consideration changes in variables)

Diff Equations (Principled backed) Vs ML (Data backed)
